Create a mobile-first responsive real estate investment web app using React.js + TailwindCSS. The app allows users to log in with OTP, explore real estate projects, go through a 4-step guided investment journey, save progress as draft, and track past or ongoing investments. The interface should be clean, intuitive, and interactive with clear CTAs and progressive step navigation.
